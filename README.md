👋 Welcome to my website!
I’m Néstor V. Balcázar-Arciniega, a Serra Húnter Professor at the Heat and Mass Transfer Technological Center (CTTC) - Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya – BarcelonaTech (UPC), specializing in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), multiphase flows, fluid mechanics, and heat and mass transfer.

My research focuses on numerical and computational methods for transport phenomena, including Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of gas–liquid systems, variable surface tension (thermocapillarity, surfactants), phase change (boiling, evaporation, condensation), and bubbly flows. I develop high-performance CFD solvers (C++/MPI) in the framework of unstructured meshes and finite-volume approach, including the Unstructured Conservative Level-Set (UCLS), Coupled VoF-LS, and Multi-Marker UCLS methods.

🔬 By the numbers:
📝 48 SCOPUS-indexed publications (51% as first author, 17 in Q1 journals, 5 in first decile JCR)
📈 h-index: 16 | FWCI: 1.844 (SCOPUS, april 2025)
🎓 4 Ph.D. theses supervised (2 industrial doctorates)
🌍 30+ international conference presentations

I frequently review for prestigious journals (e.g., Int. J. Multiph. Flow, J. Comput. Phys., Chem. Eng. J., Chem. Eng. Sci., Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow, Comput. Fluids, etc), and evaluate scientific projects (e.g. PRF-ACS).

🎓 Teaching and mentoring are key parts of  my academic mission. I lecture in: Undergraduate and Master's courses at UPC on heat and mass transfer fundamentals, energy systems (fuel cells)  and thermal equipment. Past experience includes thermodynamics at UNED (Spain) and, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and chemical reactor engineering at UTPL (Ecuador). 

💬 Let’s collaborate
I'm open to collaborations in numerical and computational methods for advanced CFD, multiphase flow, fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer, high-performance computing (C++ / MPI), and their applications in energy and chemical process engineering, hydraulics engineering, or mechanical engineering.
Whether you're interested in joint research, Ph.D. supervision, or industry-academia partnerships, I’d be happy to connect.
